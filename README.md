# chatterverse-flask
Chatterverse is a social media application built in the python web microframework <strong>flask</strong>,
from which I imported several modules including render_template (to load html files), and redirect (to redirect to different urls)

I also used the python extensions: sqlite3 (database), urllib (url handling) and regex.
